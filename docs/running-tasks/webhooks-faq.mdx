# FAQ 
## Webhooks vs HTTP requests?

We use Webhooks for executing tasks as the expected runtime of these jobs can exceed default HTTP timeouts (1 minute)

## How do we handle webhook authentication? (ie how can we handle callbacks?)

- a python example for how to generate the signature:

```python
def validate_skyvern_request_headers(request: Request) -> bool:
		header_skyvern_signature = request.headers["x-skyvern-signature"]
		payload = request.body() # this is a bytes
		hash_obj = hmac.new(SKYVERN_API_KEY.encode("utf-8"), msg=payload, digestmod=hashlib.sha256)
    client_generated_signature = hash_obj.hexdigest()
		return header_skyvern_signature == client_generated_signature
```

SKYVERN_API_KEY: this is the [api key](/running-tasks/introduction) specific to your organization

# Webhook common parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required? | Sample Value | Description |
