# Advanced Settings for tasks

## Overriding the max_steps paramter in the task
If you want the task to execute for a specific number of steps, you can use the `x-max-steps-override` header in the request. This will override the default `max_steps` parameter set in the task.

```json
POST https://api.skyvern.com/api/v1/tasks 

Headers:
{
    "x-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    "x-max-steps-override": 10
}

Body:
.. usual task body ..
```
