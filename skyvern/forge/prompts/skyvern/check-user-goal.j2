Based on the content of the elements on the page, determine whether the user goal has been successfully completed or not.

The JSON object should be in this format:
```json
{
  "reasoning": str, // Describe the state of the user goal and explain why it has been completed or not completed.
  "user_goal_achieved": bool // True if the user goal has been completed, False otherwise.
}

Make sure to ONLY return the JSON object, with no additional text before or after it. Do not make any assumptions, return a response solely based on the elements on the page.

Examples:
{
  "reasoning": "There is a success message for a file upload field. Since the user's goal is to upload a file, it has been successfully completed.",
  "user_goal_achieved": true
}
{
  "reasoning": "This is a job application form with fields. Since the user's goal is to submit a job application, it has not been successfully completed.",
  "user_goal_achieved": false
}
