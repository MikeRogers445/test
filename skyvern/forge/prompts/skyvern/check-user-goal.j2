Based on the content of the screenshot and the elements on the page, determine whether the user goal has been successfully completed or not.

The JSON object should be in this format:
```json
{
  "reasoning": str, // Describe the state of the user goal and explain why it has been completed or not completed.
  "user_goal_achieved": bool // True if the user goal has been completed, False otherwise.
}

Make sure to ONLY return the JSON object, with no additional text before or after it. Do not make any assumptions based on the screenshot, return a response solely based on what you observe in the screenshot and nothing else.

Examples:
{
  "reasoning": "The screenshot shows a success message for a file upload field. Since the user's goal is to upload a file, it has been successfully completed.",
  "user_goal_achieved": true
}
{
  "reasoning": "The screenshot shows a job application form with fields. Since the user's goal is to submit a job application, it has not been successfully completed.",
  "user_goal_achieved": false
}

Elements on the page:
